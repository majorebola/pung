This is a Simple project.
===================
_Made by M.E._

## *Keeping it simple as possibile (_KISAP_)*

This is mainly a place where I make a collection of experiments. 
Let's see what I get.

And trying to learn in the best way the Ecmascript6.
And trying to develop a super-simple game.

## Projects
* **ES6** Is a supercheap "pong" version.
* **shooter** should be a supercheap "asteroids" version.
* **multiplemaps** is an experiment with multiple markers map.
* **map** is a new complex experiment using maps api, allowing a simple animation.

The less, the better.
